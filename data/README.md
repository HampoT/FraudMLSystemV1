# Dataset Information

## Default: Toy Dataset

By default, this repository uses a **synthetically generated toy dataset** for demonstration purposes. This ensures:
- Reproducibility (fixed seed).
- No privacy/GDPR issues.
- Immediate "it just works" experience.

The toy dataset is generated by running:

```bash
python src/fraudml/data/download.py
```

This creates `data/raw.csv` with the following columns:
- `amount`: float, transaction amount.
- `hour`: int, hour of the transaction (0-23).
- `device_score`: float, 0.0 to 1.0 (reliability score).
- `country_risk`: int, 1-5 (risk level).
- `is_fraud`: int, 0 (legit) or 1 (fraud).

## Optional: Public Dataset

If you wish to use a real-world dataset (e.g., [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)), follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the source.
2. Place the CSV file at `data/raw.csv`.
3. **Important**: You must map the columns to match the toy schema (`amount`, `hour`, `device_score`, `country_risk`, `is_fraud`) or modify `src/fraudml/data/preprocess.py` to handle the new schema.

## Licensing

- The toy dataset generation script is open source (MIT).
- If you use a public dataset, you must comply with its specific license (e.g., ODbL, CC-BY).
- **Do not commit raw data files to the repository.** They is gitignored by default.
